        <h1>The History of House</h1>
        <p>
            <br />
            <br />
            It's been ten years since the first identifiably house tracks were put on to vinyl,
            ten years which have changed the technology behind the electronic music revolution
            beyond recognition but left the basic structure of house intact. It's seven years
            since it was being said house couldn't last, that it was just hi-NRG, a fast blast
            that would wither as quickly as it had started. But then the music reinvented itself,
            and then again and again until it gradually dawned on people that house wasn't just
            another phase of club culture, it was club culture, the continuing future of dance music.
            The reason? It's simple. People like to dance to house.
